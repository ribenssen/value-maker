## What it is not

## What it is
Value-Maker is the implementation of standards on Value-Adding Strategies.
Value-Maker is an environment for combining very small services, apps, operations like a value 
in the value-chain way. you achieve it by creating one or more tags.
 A tag is a small piece of a service, operation or app.
 
 
## How It Works
 It is very simple.
 1- create one or more tags (like an operation or a service).
 2- chain the tags created like a chain
 3- play the tags created (or execute those service or operations created)
 4- See the result.

## Sharing Environment
Value-Maker has 3 main environments:
- Admin console
- Repository Central
- Store Central

When you create a tag (service or operation), you register it with the Admin console for your organization.
When you want to make that tag available at your organization wide, you publish it to the Repository.
When you want to make that tag available to people outside your organization, you publish it to the Store.
